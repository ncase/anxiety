b: Do you think Martin Luther King would've said, "Shucks we can't sit in the front of the bus, let's just *accept* it?"

`bb({ eyes:"angry_r", body:"two_up" });`

b: Why does the Self-Help Industrial Complex think waving the white flag is some *profound wisdom?*

`bb({ eyes:"annoyed", body:"normal" });`

h: I think therapists mean "accept" bad things as in: acknowledging they exist and are hard to change,

h: But not necessarily giving up a commitment to change.

`bb({ eyes:"suspect" });`

b: Then therapists should say *acknowledge*, not *accept*.

`hong({ body:"chin", eyes:"annoyed" });`

h: Yeah come to think of it, "accept" is kinda confusing.

`bb({ eyes:"closed", mouth:"narrow" });`

b: Well, I *acknowledge* that.

b: Having a mental disorder *sucks!* It robs people of *lives!* Why should we "accept" that?!

`bb({ body:"normal" });`

h: I think therapists mean "accept" our emotions as in: be patient with them.

```
hong({ body:"one_up" });

h: Like how struggling in quicksand makes you sink faster, and the solution is to patiently lie flat,

`hong({ body:"normal", eyes:"normal" });`

h: Instead, the solution is to do what we're doing now – not to fight, but to patiently be with each other.

`bb({ eyes:"annoyed" });`

b: Then they should say *that* instead of some problematic word like "accept".

`hong({ body:"chin", eyes:"annoyed" });`

h: Yeah come to think of it, "accept" kind of sucks.

`bb({ eyes:"closed_annoyed", mouth:"narrow" });`

b: I do not accept "accept".

`bb({ eyes:"sad", body:"one_up" });`

`bb({ eyes:"sad_u", body:"two_up" });`

b: The whole *problem* is that I want to help you, but I suck at using words to do so!

`bb({ eyes:"sad", body:"normal" });`

h: I think therapists mean "accept" your emotions as in: "don't fight or ignore them."

`hong({ eyes:"surprise", body:"one_up" });`

h: To listen to you, work *with* you, but not take what you say as 100% literal truth.

```
hong({ eyes:"normal", body:"normal" });
bb({ eyes:"annoyed", mouth:"normal" });`

b: Then therapists should say *that* instead of some vague confusing word like "accept".
