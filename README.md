## Public Domain

Nicky Case and Monplaisir hereby dedicate all their work for this game to the public domain, under [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/).
That means: you can remix and reuse *any* of the original art / code / music in this game for *any* purpose, even commercial use!

**Q:** Do I have to give attribution?    
**A:** You're not *legally* required to, but it's highly appreciated! <3

**Q:** Legally speaking, can I claim *I* made this?    
**A:** Yes, the same way you're legally allowed to claim to have written Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, or claim you have 13 nipples.

**Q:** Can I post this game on other sites?    
**A:** Maybe. Though it's completely legal copyright-wise, many sites have their own policies against posting other people's public domain/open source work *without* significant modifications. (But if it's your own site, then by all means, please mirror this game!)

**Q:** Can I sell a port of this game?    
**A:** Yes! But to avoid confusion, I recommend labeling your game as "Fan-Made Port", and *link to this statement saying I'm explicitly allowing commercial remixes*. (Example: [a Steam port of another one of my games!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1103210/We_Become_What_We_Behold_FanMade_Port/)) This is to avoid accusations of theft from folks who weren't aware I always open-source + public-domain my projects.

**Q:** Can I turn this game into a dating sim between the human and wolf?   
**A:** uh
